							<p>For this project, I worked in a team of four as the project lead. It all started off with an idea competition to see who had the most developed and thorough concept, and mine was selected. The game was done in a weekly cycle, with each week having new tasks, new feedback, and new features. My role as project lead was to develop and manage tasks, ensure proper team communication and progress, and make certain that the quality of the game was properly maintatined. As a project member, I was in charge of audio, level design, title screen design, enemy and player movement, the smithing minigame internal logic, special move controls, portal logic, score system, entity health foundations, debuff display, and player character art. Overall this was a great learning experience both in game development and team management.</p>
